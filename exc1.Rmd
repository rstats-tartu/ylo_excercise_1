In the project folder there is an Excel file called excercise1_salaries.xlsx, which contains a measure of income for 15053 people. I am going to randomly pick one number from this file. Your task is to give your best estimate (plus/minus 100 units), what this number will be. This is your first mission, should you decide to accept it.
